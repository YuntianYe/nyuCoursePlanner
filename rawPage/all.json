Colonialism, commercial expansion, changes in economic production, and the expansion of markets, credit, and monetary instruments are often used as measures for this transition. The increasingly global circulation of commodities \u2013 some old, some new \u2013 had a profound impact on the everyday lives of both producers and consumers, inside and outside of Europe. In this emerging global economy, some of the most important commodities were valuable not because of their usefulness, but because they possessed a range of cultural and social meanings and implications, that allowed consumers to re-imagine their social status within their own societies, as well as their own societies\u2019 position within the world. By examining commodities such as spices, coffee, tea, sugar, silk, and cotton, this course aims to contextualize commerce and capitalism within the cultural and social worldviews of the people living in this period of major historical transitions and developments.

Course Description for Reactive User Interfaces: React.js has quickly become a favored tool for making interactive user interfaces for the web and beyond. One reason for this success is that React.js introduces a one-way data flow model that drastically simplifies UI development. This class takes a deep dive into the field of UI development by focusing on what makes a React.js interface different than one built with jQuery: We will look at the React component hierarchy, the JSX templating system, and how to load and display dynamic data from API\u2019s. The goal of the class is to teach students how to design and develop beautiful web interfaces that respond to user\u2019s behavior, and at the end of the class, students will have built several functional UI\u2019s in React.js.

Course Description for Circuit Design: Our daily life is surrounded by electronic products that structure their functions based on circuits. Students will explore different techniques of designing and building the kinds of circuits that drive the modern world. Through this course we will study skills used in developing these circuits, from prototyping up to manufacturing. Lectures will be accompanied by workshops to build up a set of basic skills. We will use industry standard design software to create and manipulate schematics and printed circuit boards. We will use also a variety of Open Source tools and libraries to simulate circuits and thermal analysis before building them. The work in class will be complemented with assignments that include research and practice, both in blueprints and real working prototypes. We will finish this course with a final project where students will use a project template to carry out a research on a specific area of their interest.

Course Description for Electromagnetic Creativity: Using a wide range of tools, students will approach the theory of electromagnetism through experimentation. They will analyze the different phenomena that electric and magnetic fields can produce. This learning journey will be based on analyzing practical applications, measuring electrical parameters and cross referencing them with the mathematical background explanations. As a result, we will obtain a deeper understanding of these invisible waves that surround us. Work during class will typically be divided into both a lecture and a workshop with hands on applications of the concepts covered. Weekly readings will accompany the lectures and be discussed in class. The study cases seen in class and the reports from our experimentation will give us the tools to analyze any other electromagnetic phenomena. By the end of the course, we will have a chance to dive deeper into ways that electromagnetic forces can be used in non conventional ways.

Artists such as Andy Warhol,Jeff Koons, and Tam Wai Ping among others have experimented with inflatable artwork and so will we. Inflatables are inherently, and literally, flexible allowing for objects that can be large but portable. In this class we will investigate how inflatables can be used for purposes such as actuators, interactive objects and public artwork. Using various membranes and materials we will create and experiment with our own inflatable structures.

For example, the images collected by the Hubble Telescope, since year 1990, have revolutionized modern astronomy. In biology, the use of two-photon excitation microscopy has significantly advanced neuroscience, as we are now able to track the intracellular development at sub-micron resolutions. A typical course in optics offered at any university often focuses on the fundamental aspects of light but much less on its vast applications in the real world. This short course will exemplify the power and usefulness of optics in current sciences and technology, especially in biology and engineering. This is a two-credit course to be offered at NYU Shanghai. It contains about 13 lectures that can be considered as topical introductions in different areas that utilize optics.

Students gain basic skills of analyzing and producing visual ethnography to enhance their social science research toolbox. Class readings and discussions begin with foundational issues of the intricate relationship between visuality, epistemology, and politics, and then extend into reflections over the crucial ethical questions about the author\u2019s authority as well as reciprocity with the subjects. Through close readings of landmark film works in the field, we delve into the analysis of formalistic elements that are used to construct ethnographic films, in addition to getting a historical overview of their evolution. Students develop the skills necessary to engage in discussions of critical theoretical issues in the field, and work in groups to produce a short ethnographic film as a final project. This is a seminar limited to seniors. Preferably the attendees will have foundational knowledge of anthropology, and at least one or two courses on introductory and research method courses in anthropology or sociology are required, for example, Professor Todd Meyers\u2019 course on Ethnographic Methods or Image as Evidence. Other people will be considered on a case by case situation. Interested attendees can send the instructor a description of experience.
