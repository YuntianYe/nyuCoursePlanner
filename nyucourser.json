This course is focused on the theoretical and practical techniques necessary for the actor to live truthfully within the imaginary circumstances of a character. Students participate in group and individual activities centered on self-observation, applying discoveries to improvisations, monologues, and scene work. At the onset of the class, one filmic version of the chosen play is viewed, (and if possible, attendance at a live performance of the same text), which will serve as the touchstone for class members to explore the various tenets and themes of the play, especially as to how they inform acting choices. In the first part of the semester students will concentrate on a series of lessons designed to facilitate exploration of a character's physical, intellectual and social truth. In the second half of the semester students will present monologues of their own choice (subject to approval by instructor) and scenes by applying the lessons and techniques learned. Reading and writing assignments are due as outlined in the course schedule.

Course Description: Can we capture the unpredictable evolutionary and emergent properties of nature in software? Can understanding the mathematical principles behind our physical world world help us to create digital worlds? This class focuses on the programming strategies and techniques behind computer simulations of natural systems. We explore topics ranging from basic mathematics and physics concepts to more advanced simulations of complex systems. Subjects covered include physics simulation, trigonometry, fractals, cellular automata, self-organization, and genetic algorithms. Examples are demonstrated in native JavaScript using p5.js. Much of the class time will be dedicated to in-class exercises and self-study as the course is available online through a video series and textbook.

The semester will begin with cutting up and remixing text utilizing basic find, replace, and randomization, and will then move on to topics such as regular expressions, Markov generators, Internet bots, natural language processing, and sentiment analysis. We will also look at using and analyzing data from popular social media APIs, as well as scraping and cleaning raw HTML, in order to generate new content. Students will create 3 text-based projects over the course of the semester, in addition to smaller weekly homework assignments, reading, and class discussion. The course will be taught in the Python programming language.

Toys are part of our culture, and an important medium to develop essential skills like creativity, problem-solving and socialization. They can also be a great contribution in education, medicine, and business and can improve the quality of life for children and adults alike. Students will be introduced to the essential concepts in designing toys and they will create their own by utilizing hand-making craft skills and new technologies. This course will equip students with a basic knowledge about various design topics, including: brainstorming; sketching; graphic design; concept development; mechanisms; 3D modeling; rendering and rapid prototyping. This is a hands on class, and students are required to bring their imagination in addition to a willingness to experiment and explore creative solutions for class assignments.

Course Description: This course will focus on designing, creating and performing with musical instruments that utilize recent discoveries in interactive media in order to explore the limits of human expression. Over the semester, students are asked to research examples of contemporary work by creators of musical interfaces and discuss a wide range of issues facing technology in the performing arts. Readings and case studies will provide background for class discussions on the theory and practice of designing gestural controllers for musical performance. Students will invent and prototype a complete system encompassing musical control, mapping input to sound, and the creation of sound itself. Interaction Lab is a prerequisite, but prior performing experience is not required. The performance discipline, being an inherently collaborative arena, places heavy emphasis on teamwork. An open mind to work with other artists, technologists and creative leaders is a must. The class will culminate in a performance where students will play their instruments live.

Course Description: Animatronics is a multi-disciplinary field which integrates anatomy, mechatronics and puppetry resulting in lifelike animation. In this course we will explore what factors bring devices to emulate a human or an animal. Going through a series of assignments we will bring lifelike characteristics to otherwise unanimated objects. Using open source software we will digitally create characters. Tapping into common prototyping techniques we will create advanced movements in mechanisms that will be dressed up and act as if they were alive. This will not be a tech intensive course but there is a pre-requisite of Interaction Lab because wiring, programming and laser cutting are needed. We will learn how to create sequences of actions and then how to control them remotely. Each of the participants is expected by the end of the course to be able to develop their own animatronic figure and make it behave in a realistic way.
